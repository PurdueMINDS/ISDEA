# (UPDATED) Double Equivariance for Inductive Link Prediction for Both New Nodes and New Relation Types

This repository contains the code for three (3) models introduced in the paper "Double Equivariance for Inductive Link Prediction for Both New Nodes and New Relation Types". These models are located in their respective directory as follows:

- `ISDEA/`: The legacy implementation of the Inductive Structural Double Equivariant Architecture (ISDEA).
- `ISDEA_plus/`: The new and improved Inductive Structural Double Equivariant Architecture **Plus** (ISDEA+), which achieves 20x - 120x speedup and attains superior performance compared to the legacy ISDEA.
- `DEq_InGram`: The Double Equivariant version of InGram, which achieves better performance than the original InGram on the doubly inductive link prediction task on knowledge graphs considered in the paper.

Please refer to the `README.md` file in each directory for more details on how to run the code.
